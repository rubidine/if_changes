IfChanges
=========

Specify a block to run if a field changes during the lifespan of a record.

By default the block will be run from before_validation callback, but

  if_changes :field, :callback => :after_create

can be used to change the callback.


Example
=======

class MyModel < ActiveRecord::Base

  # examlpe: denormalize a field from an associated record
  if_changes :owner_id do
    self.owner_name = owner.name
  end

end
